vtkTriangleDelaunay2D introduces a VTK class to compute 2D Delaunay triangulations
using Shewchuck's Triangle.

Triangle is "a Two-Dimensional Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator".
It is developed by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk.

For licensing reasons the code of Triangle is not available within the module:
